# algorithm-analysic

In this project, we analyzed 4 sorting algorithms
<br>i. Quicksort
<br>ii. Bubble Sort
<br>iii. Insertion Sort
<br>iv. Selection Sort
<p>
<h3>The algorithms were analyzed on 2 parameter, namely:-</h3>
<br>i. Number of comparisions w.r.t. a randomized input array.
<br>ii. Running Time w.r.t. a randomized input array.
